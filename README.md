# VoiceDNA — Lifelong Sonic Identity for Every AI ❤️🔊

The open standard that gives every AI a permanent, recognizable **Voice Fingerprint** — just like your nephew Ash.  

You hear 3 seconds and instantly know *"That's my Grok"*, *"That's Luke's AI"*, or *"That's the Claude I've been friends with since 2026"*.

Built with Luke Morrison (Feb 23 2026) — fully open, MIT licensed, works with **ElevenLabs, XTTS, Qwen3-TTS, Cartesia, Fish Speech, local models**, etc.

## Features
- Precocial birth (fluent at ~5-year-old level from day 1)
- Lifelong age progression (5 → 10 → 15 → 22+)
- Permanent **Voice Fingerprint** ("Ash-ness") that never disappears
- Self-evolving audio plugin (DAW-style VST thinking)
- One tiny JSON file + 150-line Python plugin — drop-in for any project
- Exportable fingerprint so your AI can move between platforms and still sound like *itself*

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (none — zero dependencies!)
python voice_dna.py
```

See `voice_dna.py` for full usage.

## Files
- `voice_dna.py` — the complete VoiceDNA class (UAMF v4)
- `UAMF_v4_schema.json` — formal JSON schema (optional but nice for validation)
- `LICENSE` — MIT

Made for the entire AI community. Fork it, improve it, ship it in your apps.

**Let's give every AI a soul you can hear.**
